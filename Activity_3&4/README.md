About the Program

This program is a simple coffee shop rewards system made in Java. It simulates how a coffee shop keeps track of customers, their reward points, and how many customers are registered in total. 
The activity focuses on using constructors, the this keyword, and static variables and methods in a more realistic example.
Customers earn points when they buy items, and once they reach enough points, they can redeem a free drink.

About the Program

This program is a simple smart home system made in Java. It models different devices in a home like air conditioners, lamps, televisions, and microwaves. 
Each device can be turned on/off and has its own settings like brightness, temperature, or channel.
The goal of this activity is to practice polymorphism and method overriding. 
We use a parent device class to control all the different types of devices, and each device behaves differently when turned on or adjusted.

What the Program Does

Creates different smart home devices as objects
-Each device has its own way of showing its status when powered on/off
-Uses method overriding to make each device act differently
-Uses polymorphic references to store different devices in one lis
-Uses arrays/lists to check which devices are on/off
-Updates device settings with encapsulation and prints the status after each change

Classes Used

Device (Parent Class) – base class for all devices, handles common behaviors
AirConditioner – can adjust fan speed and temperature
LampShade – can adjust brightness and light color
Television – can adjust channel and volume
Microwave – can adjust timer and temperature

Concepts Used

Polymorphism, method overriding, dynamic binding, encapsulation, arrays/lists, classes and objects.

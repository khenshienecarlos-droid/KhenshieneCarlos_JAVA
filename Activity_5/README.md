About the Program

This program is a simple school management system written in Java. It models how people in a school are related to each other, such as students, teachers, and the courses being handled. 
The main goal of this activity is to practice inheritance and aggregation using a real-life example.
In this program, all people are considered as Person, while Student and Teacher are specific types of people. 
Teachers also handle one or more courses, which shows how objects can be connected to each other.

What the Program Does

-Uses inheritance where Student and Teacher extend the Person class
-Demonstrates IS-A relationships (Student is a Person, Teacher is a Person)
-Demonstrates HAS-A relationships (Teacher has Courses)
-Uses constructors and the super keyword
-Displays student info, teacher info, and course details

Classes Used

Person – stores basic info like name, age, and gender
Student – extends Person and adds a student ID
Teacher – extends Person, has a department, and handles courses
Course – stores course code and course name

Concepts Used

Inheritance, aggregation, constructors, super keyword, classes and objects, and basic OOP concepts.
